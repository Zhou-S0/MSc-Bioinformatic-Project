# Deep Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) for Transcriptome Signature Reversion

## Project Overview
This repository contains an improved **Deep Variational Autoencoder (DVAE)**, adapted from a previous MSc Project. The DVAE was implemented in TensorFlow/Keras for working with high‑dimensional gene‑expression data. It is designed to support projects like **Transcriptome Signature Reversion (TSR)**, where patient tumour expression profiles and treatment (e.g., miRNA/drug) signatures are embedded into a common **latent space** to quantify similarity (e.g., with cosine similarity) and evaluate reversal potential.
